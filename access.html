<h1>Accessibility</h1>


<p>On this page, the importance of accessibility will be explored.</p>

<h2>Accessibility principles</h2>

<!-- list for testing -->

<ul>
<li>Perceivable</li>
<li>Operable</li>
<li>Understandable</li>
<li>Robust</li>
</ul>

<p>Those 4 principles are important as they are the base to make any web page accessible. <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/pour/">The principles can be explored on the WebAIM website</a>. They are important as computers are tools that have the potential to be used by everyone</p>

<p>It is very easy to make a website inaccessible without noticing it. Some of the most common errors that people make are low contrat on text, missing alternative text on images and empty form label.</p>

<p>As an example, for the contrast issue the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">WCAG success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> can be used as a ressource to understand the issue. There are also tools to help fix the issue</p>
